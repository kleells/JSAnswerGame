A coding tutorial created to review and practice basic JavaScript by creating a few games. Completed through Mammoth Interactive at [link to Mammoth Interactive Homepage](https://training.mammothinteractive.com/courses).

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Dependencies
None. Viewer only needs to utilize Live Server through the index.html file.

## Uses
To build and style a HTML file with CSS. Then to add user functionality with JavaScript. I also used this project to focus on the structure of my JS file. Trying to create consistent line breaks, use of quotation marks, etc

## How I veered from the original project
- changed the sentence structure of answers coded in JS file
- added different holidays that instructor
- changed some longer const/var/let names
- 

## History
After completing a Software Engineering certification program and during my job search, I needed to continue to pracitce my skill set in order to maintain it and learn more. I thought that even the most basic projects using the most basic languages was a great place to start.
